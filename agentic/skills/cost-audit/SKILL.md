# Cost Audit

## Step 1: Collect Current Costs

### GCP

```bash
gcloud billing accounts list
gcloud billing budgets list --billing-account={ACCOUNT_ID}
# Or use the billing export in BigQuery
```

### AWS

```bash
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=$(date -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d),End=$(date +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE
```

## Step 2: Cost Breakdown by Category

```text
Compute serving (N APIs × 2 clouds):  $___/mo
Compute training (Spot, monthly avg):  $___/mo
Databases (Cloud SQL + RDS):           $___/mo
Storage (GCS + S3):                    $___/mo
Registry (Artifact Registry + ECR):    $___/mo
Monitoring and Logging:                $___/mo
TOTAL:                                 $___/mo
```

## Step 2b: Push to Pushgateway (Business KPIs dashboard)

`dashboard-business.json`'s "Monthly Cloud Cost vs. Budget" panel reads
`<service>_monthly_cloud_cost_usd` from Prometheus — this step is what
populates it. Monthly cadence, matching this skill's own review cycle
(intentionally NOT a real-time cost exporter — see
`docs/observability/business-kpis.md` (belongs to ml-service-template; nothing here defines business KPIs yet) for why that would be
over-engineering at this template's scale).

```bash
echo "{@ service_slug @}_monthly_cloud_cost_usd ${TOTAL_MONTHLY_COST_USD}" | \
  curl --data-binary @- \
  "${PUSHGATEWAY_URL:-http://pushgateway:9091}/metrics/job/cost-audit/service/{@ service_slug @}"
```

## Step 3: Check FinOps Rules

| Rule | Status | Action if Violated |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------- |
| Training on Spot/Preemptible | ✅/❌ | Switch to spot instances (70% savings) |
| Serving on On-Demand | ✅/❌ | Do not change — availability required |
| CPU-only HPA (no idle pods) | ✅/❌ | Fix HPA to avoid over-provisioning |
| Lifecycle policies on buckets | ✅/❌ | Archive after N days, delete after M |
| Budget alerts at 50%/90% | ✅/❌ | Configure in Terraform |
| Non-prod clusters destroyed | ✅/❌ | `terraform destroy -var-file=staging.tfvars` |

## Step 4: Identify Optimization Opportunities

- **Right-sizing**: Check if node pool machine types match actual usage
- **Committed use**: If stable baseline, consider 1-year CUDs (30% savings)
- **Storage tiering**: Move infrequently accessed data to Nearline/Glacier
- **Image cleanup**: Delete old container images past retention period
- **Unused resources**: Check for orphaned disks, IPs, load balancers

## Step 5: Update Documentation

Update the TCO section in service READMEs and relevant ADRs with:

- Real measured costs (not estimates)
- Date of measurement
- Comparison with previous period
- Optimization actions taken and their impact

## Step 6: Budget Alert Verification

```bash
# GCP
terraform plan -target=google_billing_budget.ml_budget

# AWS
terraform plan -target=aws_budgets_budget.ml_budget
```

Verify alerts fire at 50% and 90% of monthly budget.

## Success criteria

The audit is complete when ALL of the following hold:

- [ ] Current costs collected from BOTH clouds (GCP billing + AWS Cost Explorer)
- [ ] Total monthly cost pushed to Pushgateway as `<service>_monthly_cloud_cost_usd`
      (Step 2b) so `dashboard-business.json` reflects the current review
- [ ] Cost breakdown table populated with concrete dollar amounts per category
      (compute, storage, network, monitoring, MLflow tracking)
- [ ] Variance vs previous month documented; any single category with > 5%
      change has a one-line explanation
- [ ] Each FinOps rule violation has a corrective action with owner + due date
- [ ] Optimization opportunities ranked by estimated monthly savings
- [ ] ADRs and service READMEs updated with real measured costs (not estimates)
- [ ] Audit entry written to `ops/audit.jsonl` with operation=`cost_review`,
      result=`success`, link to the report
- [ ] Total spend < 120% of budget — else escalation_triggers fires STOP

If `apply_optimizations` was invoked (STOP-class), an additional human
sign-off must be linked from the audit entry per template-ADR-005.
