# Scaffold Update — Pull template improvements into an existing service

## When to use

When the template repository has shipped improvements (new D-XX rules,
updated CI workflows, security patches, agentic system upgrades) and a
scaffolded service needs to absorb them.

## When NOT to use

- **During active incidents** — stabilize first, update later.
- **On services with uncommitted changes** — `copier update` requires a
  clean working tree.
- **On services created outside the scaffolder** — no `.copier-answers.yml`
  means Copier cannot track the template version.

## Pre-conditions

1. The service was scaffolded via `copier copy`. There is no wrapper script
   here — that belongs to `ml-service-template`, whose scaffolder is a shell
   script.
2. `.copier-answers.yml` exists in the service root (created by the
   initial `copier copy` or a prior `copier update`).
3. The service working tree is clean (`git status` shows no changes).
4. The template repository is accessible (local path or git remote).

## Steps

### Step 1 — Pre-flight checks (AUTO, 30s)

> **`--vcs-ref` is not optional.** Copier resolves an unpinned source to the
> highest-sorting tag, and the template carries frozen `v1.x` audit snapshots
> beside its active `v0.x` line. Unpinned, `copier update` rewrites the service
> BACKWARDS: upstream measured 582 files deleted on a real service, including
> `.copier-answers.yml` — the record `update` reads, so it cannot then recover.
> This text was inherited before that fix and carried the defect with it.

```bash
cd "$service-path"
git status --porcelain  # must be empty
test -f .copier-answers.yml  # must exist
```

If either check fails → STOP with a clear message.

### Step 2 — Dry-run diff (AUTO, 1min)

Show what would change without applying:

```bash
copier update --trust --vcs-ref=v0.24.0 --pretend
```

Categorize the diff:

- **No-op**: files the service hasn't customized → safe to auto-apply.
- **Conflict**: files the service has modified → require manual review.
- **New files**: template additions not present in the service → safe.

### Step 3 — Review with operator (CONSULT)

Present the categorized diff to the operator. For each conflict:

1. Show the template version (upstream).
2. Show the service version (local).
3. Propose a resolution strategy (keep local, adopt upstream, merge).

Wait for explicit approval before proceeding.

### Step 4 — Apply update (CONSULT → approved)

```bash
copier update --trust --defaults --vcs-ref=v0.24.0
```

Copier will:

- Re-render all template files with the latest template version.
- Preserve files the service has customized (via `.copier-answers.yml`
  conflict detection).
- Run post-generation tasks (`sync_agentic_adapters.py` +
  `validate_agentic_manifest.py --strict`).

### Step 5 — Resolve conflicts (CONSULT, if any)

For each conflict Copier reports:

1. Read both versions.
2. Propose a merge that preserves service customizations while
   absorbing template improvements.
3. Apply the merge.
4. Mark the conflict as resolved.

### Step 6 — Validate (AUTO, 2min)

Run the full validation suite on the updated service:

```bash
# Agentic system
python3 scripts/validate_agentic_manifest.py --strict
python3 scripts/sync_agentic_adapters.py

# CI/CD
python3 scripts/ci_verify_workflows.py

# K8s
for ov in gcp-dev gcp-staging gcp-prod aws-dev aws-staging aws-prod; do
  kubectl kustomize k8s/overlays/$ov > /dev/null
done

# Tests
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

### Step 7 — Commit (CONSULT)

Propose a commit message summarizing the template version absorbed and
the files changed. Wait for operator approval before committing.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: absorb template update $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

Template version: <sha or tag>
Files changed: <count>
Conflicts resolved: <count>
Post-gen tasks: sync_agentic_adapters.py + validate_agentic_manifest.py --strict"
```

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT force-push or override branch protection.
- Does NOT update the template repository itself (that's a separate
  workflow for template maintainers).
- Does NOT skip the post-gen agentic validation — if
  `validate_agentic_manifest.py --strict` fails, the update is
  considered incomplete.

## Invariants

- `.copier-answers.yml` is the source of truth for template version
  tracking. Never delete or hand-edit it.
- Post-gen tasks MUST run to completion — a service with stale agentic
  adapters is worse than no update.
- Breaking template changes (renamed questions, removed files) require
  a migration ADR before the update can proceed.
