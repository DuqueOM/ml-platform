"""Lazy resolver for the service's Pandera ``ServiceInputSchema``.

Why a separate module
=====================

The Pandera schema is the *single source of truth* for input validation
(training, serving, drift — see ADR-016 PR-R2-4). It lives under
``src/demand_forecast_serving/schemas.py`` because that is where ``train.py`` consumes
it via a relative import.

The FastAPI router in :mod:`app.fastapi_app` cannot ``from
demand_forecast_serving.schemas import ServiceInputSchema`` directly: at template-test
time the package name is the literal placeholder ``demand_forecast_serving`` (not a
valid Python identifier) and the import fails at *parse* time, before
any ``try`` block can rescue it.

This module performs the resolution at *runtime* using
:func:`importlib.import_module`, controlled by the ``SERVICE_PACKAGE``
environment variable. After ``new-service.sh`` rewrites the project,
``SERVICE_PACKAGE`` defaults to the rendered slug; before scaffolding,
the resolution fails silently and ``ServiceInputSchema`` is ``None`` —
the validators in :mod:`common_utils.input_validation` treat ``None`` as
a no-op so structural tests still pass.

Operational contract
====================

* In a scaffolded service running in production, ``ServiceInputSchema``
  MUST resolve to the Pandera class. The CI lint added in PR-R2-4
  (``validate-templates.yml``) verifies that ``fastapi_app.py``
  references ``ServiceInputSchema`` and that ``drift_detection.py``
  imports it via the relative path; together these guarantee the
  contract is enforced everywhere it matters.
* The fallback to ``None`` is reserved for the unrendered template +
  structural unit tests. A real deploy is expected to set
  ``SERVICE_PACKAGE`` (Helm + Kustomize do this automatically via the
  ConfigMap). The :func:`get_pandera_schema` accessor logs a single
  warning when it falls back so that misconfigured deploys are visible
  in the pod log.
