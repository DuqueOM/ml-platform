"""Promotion-gate evidence bundle (ADR-015 PR-B4).

The "evidence bundle" is the set of files + facts that MUST exist
and MUST agree before a model is promoted to the MLflow Registry:

1. ``training_manifest.json`` (PR-B3) is present next to the model
   artifact and parses cleanly at the current loader version.
2. ``manifest.quality_gates_passed`` is ``True``.
3. ``manifest.split.strategy`` is set (a deliberate split was chosen,
   not the unacknowledged-random default that ``Trainer._split_data``
   would have rejected).
4. ``manifest.eda_artifacts_dir`` is set, points at a real directory,
   and the ``leakage_report.json`` it contains has
   ``status == "PASSED"`` (PR-B2 contract).
5. The model artifact's SHA-256 matches ``manifest.model_artifact_sha256``
   — provenance integrity, no swap between training and promotion.

This module is pure stdlib + the two ``common_utils`` peers
(``training_manifest``, ``eda_artifacts``). It does NOT import MLflow,
sklearn, pandas, or any heavy ML dependency, so:

- Unit tests run fast in any environment.
- ``promote_to_mlflow.py`` can call ``evaluate_evidence`` BEFORE its
  lazy MLflow import — a missing artifact fails in milliseconds with
  exit code 4 instead of after a 30-second MLflow connection.

Why a separate module from ``promote_to_mlflow.py``?
The same gate is reused by:
- ``promote_to_mlflow.py`` (the CLI gate).
- The retrain workflow's evaluation step (``Agent-RetrainingAgent``)
  which uses ``evaluate_evidence`` to decide whether to even attempt
  registration.
- Future post-incident audit tooling that reconstructs "was the
  promotion criteria met at promotion time?" from a saved verdict.

Out of scope
------------
- Cosign image signature verification: signing is a different gate
  (PR-A5 / D-19) — happens at deploy time, on the IMAGE that ships
  this manifest. The two gates compose; neither subsumes the other.
- Cross-run lineage (parent_model_uri, comparison to current
  champion). The retrain workflow already evaluates Champion vs
  Challenger using metrics; this module is the EVIDENCE gate, not
  the comparison gate.
- "Soft" failures with severity levels. Every check here is binary:
  it passes or it blocks promotion. A check that warned-but-allowed
  would defeat the gate's purpose.

    Why this returns a verdict instead of raising:
    The CLI wants to print EVERY failure, not the first one. Tests
    want to assert on the failure list. Audit tooling wants to
    persist the verdict. A raise-on-first-failure model would force
    every consumer to wrap try/except around partial state.
