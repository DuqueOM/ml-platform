# ============================================================================
# Per-environment IAM split (ADR-017 / PR-A1)
# ============================================================================
# Five identities, each with the minimal permissions for its purpose:
#
#   ci       — Terraform plan/apply, image build push (used by GitHub Actions)
#   deploy   — Push images, update K8s manifests (used by deploy workflows)
#   runtime  — Pod runtime: read secrets, read storage (Workload Identity)
#   drift    — Drift CronJob: read metrics, write reports (Workload Identity)
#   retrain  — Retrain workflow: read data, write models (Workload Identity)
#
# Why 5 separate identities instead of one:
#   * Audit trail: a Cloud Audit Logs entry tells you EXACTLY which workflow
#     touched a resource. With a single identity you only know "the template
#     did it".
#   * Blast radius: a leaked CI key cannot read production model artifacts;
#     a leaked runtime key cannot push images.
#   * Least-privilege contract test: enforcing "no identity has *.admin"
#     is meaningful only when permissions are split by purpose.
#
# All identities are project-scoped (no org-level grants). Per-environment
# isolation is achieved by deploying this Terraform once per env, which
# creates env-suffixed names (e.g. ci-sa-staging, ci-sa-production).
#
# Parity note — why no iam-roles-split.tf (unlike AWS):
#   AWS splits `iam.tf` (per-SERVICE IRSA roles via for_each) from
#   `iam-roles-split.tf` (per-PURPOSE ci/deploy/drift/retrain roles) to
#   keep the for_each contract clean. GCP does not have per-service
#   identities — all services share the single `runtime` SA and gain
#   access via per-secret / per-bucket IAM bindings in secrets.tf and
#   logging.tf. So per-purpose and per-service concerns don't collide
#   here, and splitting the file would only add directory noise.
#   Cloud parity is at the semantic level (same 5 identities, same
#   permissions contract), not the filename level. See
#   test_iam_least_privilege.py for enforcement.
