# Grafana dashboard inventory

Centralized inventory of every Grafana dashboard the template ships.
External-feedback gap 6.4 (May 2026 triage): dashboards existed but
were not centrally registered, making completeness invisible to
adopters. This file is the **source of truth**: every shipped
dashboard MUST appear here with audience, panel summary, source data,
and the runbook that consumes it.

| Dashboard | File | Audience | Source data | Runbook |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| ML service overview | `dashboard-template.json` | On-call SRE / ML engineer | Prometheus `<service>_*` metrics emitted by FastAPI app | `docs/runbooks/incident.md` |
| Closed-loop monitoring | `dashboard-closed-loop.json` | ML engineer / data scientist | Prediction logger + drift CronJob output | `docs/runbooks/closed-loop-sla.md`, `docs/decisions/ADR-008-champion-challenger.md` |
| DORA delivery metrics | `dashboard-dora.json` | Engineering manager / Staff+ | `dora_*` Prometheus series (see Pipeline below) | `/performance-review` workflow |
| Business KPIs | `dashboard-business.json` | Product owner / business stakeholder | `<service>_*` metrics + `<service>_monthly_cloud_cost_usd` (see Pipeline below) | `docs/observability/business-kpis.md` |
| Edge protection | `dashboard-edge.json` | Platform / security engineer | `edge_protection_enabled` + `edge_protection_last_audit_timestamp` (see Pipeline below) | `docs/runbooks/edge-protection-setup.md` |

## Pipeline contract per dashboard

### `dashboard-template.json`

Direct: FastAPI app emits Prometheus counters / histograms via
`prometheus_client`. No additional plumbing required. Variables
`Demand Forecast Serving` and `demand_forecast_serving` are substituted by `new-service.sh`
at scaffold time.

### `dashboard-closed-loop.json`

The dashboard reads metrics that the prediction logger (D-21/D-22)
and drift CronJob (CRIT-2/3) write to Prometheus directly. SLO
burn-rate panels reference the rules in `slo-prometheusrule.yaml`
(CRIT-1).

### `dashboard-dora.json`

`scripts/dora_metrics.py` writes JSON to `ops/dora/{YYYY-MM}-metrics.json`.
It does NOT emit Prometheus metrics itself — the design is
intentionally deployment-agnostic.

To populate the dashboard, the adopter MUST add a small companion
job (CronJob or GitHub Action) that:

1. Runs `python scripts/dora_metrics.py --output /tmp/dora.json`.
2. Translates each JSON field to a Prometheus push-gateway POST
   under the metric names referenced by the dashboard:
   - `dora_deploy_frequency_per_week`
   - `dora_lead_time_hours_p50`
   - `dora_change_failure_rate_percent`
   - `dora_mttr_minutes_p50`
   - `dora_deploys_total`
   - `dora_rollbacks_total`
3. Tags each series with `service="<scaffolded slug>"`.

A reference CronJob is intentionally NOT shipped with the template
(every adopter's Pushgateway endpoint, auth, and retention policy
differ). The contract is fully documented here so the wiring is
mechanical.

### `dashboard-business.json`

Mostly direct: request volume, SLA compliance, and prediction mix reuse
metrics/recording rules the FastAPI app and `slo-prometheusrule.yaml`
already emit — no additional plumbing.

The one series that needs wiring is `<service>_monthly_cloud_cost_usd`.
Same pattern as DORA above: the `cost-audit` skill computes the number
(see its SKILL.md "Push to Pushgateway" step) and pushes it as a gauge
tagged `service="<scaffolded slug>"`. Cadence is monthly, matching the
skill's own review cycle — this is intentionally NOT a real-time cost
exporter (see `docs/observability/business-kpis.md` for why that would
be over-engineering at this template's scale).

The dashboard's cost-vs-budget coloring threshold is a manually-set
Grafana field value, not a second synced metric — update it to match
your own `company_context.monthly_budget_usd` after scaffolding.

### `dashboard-edge.json`

Neither series is emitted by the FastAPI app — both are pushed by the
`edge-audit` skill's Step 4b (`agentic/skills/edge-audit/SKILL.md`),
one push per overlay audited:

- `edge_protection_enabled{overlay}` — gauge, 1 or 0.
- `edge_protection_last_audit_timestamp{overlay}` — gauge, unix time
  of the push itself.

Run `edge-audit` (or `make edge-setup OVERLAY=<overlay>`) at least
once per overlay after scaffolding, and periodically thereafter — the
`EdgeAuditHeartbeatMissing` alert fires if no push lands within 14
days, since a stale coverage verdict is worse than an honestly-missing
one (it looks protected when nobody has actually checked recently).

## Adding a new dashboard

1. Drop the JSON into this directory with the file name
   `dashboard-<topic>.json`.
2. Add a row to the table above with audience + source data + runbook.
3. Reference the dashboard from at least one runbook so it has a
   user, not just a producer.
4. If the dashboard relies on a series the template does not yet
   emit, document the wiring under "Pipeline contract per dashboard"
   above — same level of detail as the DORA section.

The CI gate enforces that this INDEX.md mentions every JSON file
present in this directory (see
`.github/workflows/validate-templates.yml::dashboard-inventory`
job — added in PR-1 of the May 2026 feedback triage).
