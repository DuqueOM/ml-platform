# Validate every Kubernetes manifest under a k8s/ tree — base and overlays.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Two separate copies of this validation existed, and both were narrower than
# the surface they guarded:
#
#   * the template repo's `Kubernetes Manifests` job named **seven** base
#     manifests literally. `k8s/base/` holds fourteen. Seven — including
#     `pdb.yaml` and `networkpolicy-deny-default.yaml`, both core API types
#     kubeconform validates fully — were never checked, and adding a
#     fifteenth would have been unchecked too. It validated no overlay at all.
#
#   * the generated service's `ci-infra.yml` looped over `k8s/overlays/gcp-*`
#     and `k8s/overlays/aws-*`. There are seven overlays; `batch-only` matches
#     neither glob. Both steps also carried `continue-on-error: true`, so
#     their result was advisory — and a loop over a glob that matches nothing
#     is indistinguishable from a loop that validated everything.
#
# This is one implementation with two callers, vendored byte-identical
# (`scripts/check_vendored_runtime_drift.py`), so the template cannot hold
# itself to a different bar than it ships.
#
# The contract it enforces beyond "these files parse"
# ---------------------------------------------------
# **Zero is a failure.** Every discovery step asserts it found something. A
# validator that silently validates nothing is the failure mode this repo
# keeps finding; it reports the same green as one that validated everything.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   validate_k8s_manifests.sh <k8s-dir>
#
#   <k8s-dir>  directory containing `base/` and `overlays/`, e.g. `k8s` in a
#              generated service or `templates/service/k8s` in this repo.
#
# Requires `kubeconform` and `kustomize` on PATH.
#
# Exit codes
# ----------
#   0  every discovered manifest and overlay validated.
#   1  a manifest failed validation, or a discovery step found nothing.
#   2  usage error, or a required tool is missing.

# `-ignore-missing-schemas` is deliberate and load-bearing: the tree contains
# CRDs (Argo Rollouts, AnalysisTemplate, Prometheus PrometheusRule) whose
# schemas are not in the upstream catalogue. It weakens the check for those
# kinds only — every core-API object is still validated in full under
# `-strict`, which additionally rejects unknown fields.

# NOTE — why the element counts are kept in plain variables.
# This file is vendored into `templates/service/scripts/`, where Copier
# renders every file as a Jinja template (`_templates_suffix: ""`). Bash's
# array-length syntax opens a brace immediately followed by a hash, which is
# exactly Copier's comment-start token, so using it made `copier copy` fail
# with "Missing end of comment tag" — the scaffolder, not this script.
# Counters avoid the token. Enforced by
# `scripts/check_template_render_safety.py`.
