"""Shared pytest fixtures for Demand Forecast Serving test suite.

The fastapi app (`app.main`) uses a lifespan that loads model artifacts
from disk and runs a warm-up. Tests cannot rely on real artifacts being
present, so we patch the loader + warmup at module level BEFORE the
lifespan runs (i.e., before TestClient is instantiated).

The ``client`` fixture here is the canonical test client; individual
tests should depend on it rather than constructing their own.
