"""Integration test configuration for Demand Forecast Serving.

These tests validate the full service stack (API + model + dependencies).
Requires the service to be running (e.g., via docker-compose or make serve).

Usage:
    # Start the service first
    docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d
    # Or: make serve (in another terminal)

    # Run integration tests
    pytest tests/integration/ -v
