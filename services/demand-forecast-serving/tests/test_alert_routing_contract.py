"""PR-C2 — Alert routing contract.

Every alert rule shipped by the template (PrometheusRule CRDs in
``k8s/base/`` and the legacy plain-rule files under ``monitoring/``)
must carry both:

1. A ``runbook_url`` annotation. On-call humans cannot triage from a
   summary alone; without a link to the procedure the alert is just
   noise. Phase 1.3 already standardised this for two files; PR-C2
   makes it MANDATORY across every PrometheusRule the template ships,
   discovered automatically so a new rule file added later cannot
   silently bypass the gate.

2. An ``action`` label in ``{page, ticket, notify}``. AlertManager
   routes on labels, not annotations or severity strings (which differ
   between files — ``P1`` vs ``critical`` vs ``warning``). Pinning the
   routing decision to ``action`` decouples the routing config from the
   inevitable drift in severity vocabulary and makes each alert
   declare, at the point of definition, what the on-call response is.

In addition, the SLO file is required to follow the Google SRE
multi-window/multi-burn-rate pattern (PR-C2): at least one alert must
combine a long and a short window with ``and`` so that resolved
incidents stop paging within the short window.

This test is YAML-only — no Prometheus runtime, no jsonschema. It is
wired into the scaffold smoke chain.
