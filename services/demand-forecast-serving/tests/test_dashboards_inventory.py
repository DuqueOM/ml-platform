"""Contract test — Grafana dashboards inventory (R4-L2).

Authority: ACTION_PLAN_R4 §L2 + ACTION_PLAN_R5 §Sprint 3.

The inventory document `docs/observability/dashboards-inventory.md`
is the single source of truth listing every Grafana dashboard the
template ships. Without a contract test, the document drifts out of
sync every time a dashboard is added, removed, or renamed. Drift is
the exact failure mode R4-L2 flagged.

Invariants enforced:

1. Every JSON file under `templates/monitoring/grafana/` is listed
   in the inventory document's "Dashboards shipped" table. If a new
   dashboard is added without updating the doc, the test fails.
2. Every filename mentioned in the inventory's file column actually
   exists on disk. Catches accidental renames.
3. Every dashboard file parses as valid JSON (defense against
   merge-conflict artifacts in `templates/monitoring/grafana/`).
4. Every panel's `type` claimed in the per-dashboard panels table
   matches the actual JSON for panels in the same order. We validate
   the count matches and every claimed type appears in the JSON.

The test is structural and fast — it does NOT require Grafana or
Prometheus to be available.
