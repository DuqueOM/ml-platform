"""Tests for the data-path contract (Phase 1.4).

The training pipeline, retrain workflow, and drift CronJob all read from
`data/`. If they disagree on the directory layout, the workflow runs
green in CI but produces empty datasets, NaN drift scores, or models
trained on yesterday's snapshot. This test file pins the contract.

Three orthogonal invariants:

1. **All canonical directories exist** in the scaffolded service.
   Catches the regression where `data/production/` was missing from
   `new-service.sh::mkdir -p` (the drift CronJob then crashes on first
   run with FileNotFound).
2. **The drift CronJob's `--current` path matches the scaffolded
   directory.** Hand-edit the YAML to point at `data/prod/latest.csv`
   and the test fails.
3. **The retrain workflow downloads to the same path that `train.py`
   reads from.** A typo in `retrain-service.yml` like `data/raw/latests.csv`
   would otherwise be invisible until the next retrain cycle.
