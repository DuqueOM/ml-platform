"""PR-A4 — Day-2 ops artifacts contract.

Two artifacts ship under PR-A4:

  1. ``docs/runbooks/day-2-operations.md`` — the single multi-cloud
     Day-2 ops runbook. ADR-015's rejected-items table explicitly
     refused the two-runbook split (`CHECKLIST_DAY2_GCP.md` +
     `CHECKLIST_DAY2_AWS.md`); this file IS the canonical alternative.

  2. ``.github/workflows/terraform-plan-nightly.yml`` (in the
     scaffolded service) / ``cicd/terraform-plan-nightly.yml`` (in
     the template repo) — the nightly drift-detection workflow.

This test asserts both artifacts are present and carry the load-
bearing structural elements they're meant to. It is YAML/Markdown
only — no terraform, no kubectl, no GitHub API.

Why a structural test (instead of a "does it work" test): the
correctness of `terraform plan` is owned by HashiCorp, and the
correctness of every bash snippet in the runbook is owned by the
operator running it. What the TEMPLATE owes is the *contract*:
both artifacts exist, both cover the agreed topics, neither has
silently lost a section due to a careless edit. This is the same
philosophy as PR-C2 (alert routing) and PR-A5b (placeholder
vocabulary): structural gates that prevent regression.
