"""Contract — every ``dvc.yaml`` stage command must be able to run.

Why this exists
---------------
``dvc.yaml`` declared four stages. **Three of them could not run**, and had not
been able to for as long as the file existed:

* ``validate`` invoked ``training/validate_data.py`` — a file that has never
  existed in this template.
* ``featurize`` invoked ``training/features.py`` — a real file, but one that
  defines ``FeatureEngineer`` and has no ``__main__`` and no argument parser.
  The stage would exit 0 having produced nothing, and DVC would then fail on
  the missing output, blaming the output.
* ``train`` invoked ``training/train.py`` as a plain script, which raises
  ``ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package``.

Only ``evaluate``'s shape was right, and it pointed at ``training/evaluate.py``
— also non-existent. So `dvc repro` had never completed in any generated
service, and nothing said so, because no test read this file at all.

What this checks
----------------
For each stage command:

1. **The target exists.** A module invocation resolves to a real module; a
   script invocation resolves to a real file.
2. **The invocation form is sound.** A script invocation of a file with
   relative imports is rejected — see
   ``test_python_entrypoint_invocations.py`` for why that is fatal.
3. **The target is actually callable that way.** A module run with ``-m`` needs
   an entrypoint; a bare class definition is not one. This is the check that
   would have caught ``featurize``, whose file existed and whose form was legal
   and which still could not do anything.

Static throughout: it does not run DVC, which needs data, a remote and a
configured cache.
