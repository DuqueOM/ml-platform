"""Contract test — Locust payload <-> Pydantic schema parity (R5-M4).

This test enforces that the load test (``templates/service/tests/load_test.py``)
sends payloads that the live API (``templates/service/app/schemas.py``)
will actually accept. Without this contract, load tests can drift to
hitting validation errors and report misleading latency / RPS numbers.

The test imports both modules and validates the load test's
``SAMPLE_PAYLOAD`` against ``PredictionRequest`` and ``BATCH_PAYLOAD``
against ``BatchPredictionRequest``. If a future change to ``schemas.py``
renames or adds a required field, the load test must be updated in the
same commit; this test catches the drift at PR-time, not at first
real load run.

Authority: ACTION_PLAN_R5 §R5-M4.
