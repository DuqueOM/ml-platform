"""Contract — anything that invokes a repository Python file must invoke it a way that can work.

Why this exists
---------------
Three Makefile targets ran the trainer as a plain script::

    python src/<slug>/training/train.py --data <path>

``train.py`` begins with ``from ..config import QualityGatesConfig``. Running a
file that lives inside a package as a top-level script gives it no package
context, so Python raises before the first line of logic::

    ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package

``make train`` therefore could not work in any generated service, and had not
been able to for as long as those imports have been relative. Nothing noticed,
because no test ever asked whether a recipe was runnable — the shipped suite
tests the code the recipes call, never the calling.

Why this file is no longer about the Makefile
---------------------------------------------
The first version of this guard read the Makefile and nothing else. The
Makefile was fixed and the guard went green, and the identical broken
invocation stayed live in **eight other places**, including the two that
matter most:

* ``.github/workflows/retrain-service.yml`` — the shipped retraining workflow.
  The *same file* already used the module form four steps later, so one
  automated retrain would have died on the script form and the evidence of the
  correct form was sitting in the same YAML.
* ``dvc.yaml`` — the ``train`` stage of the data pipeline.
* ``README.md`` and ``docs/service-readme-template.md`` — the first command a
  new adopter runs.
* the ``model-retrain`` skill and the ``retrain`` workflow, in each of their
  three agentic copies.

A guard scoped to the Makefile while the defect lives in workflows, pipeline
definitions and documentation is a control narrower than its surface — the
same shape as the bug it was written to catch. This module now reads every
shipped surface that can invoke a repository Python file.

What this checks
----------------
For every invocation of a repository Python file found in any scanned surface,
whichever form it uses must be consistent with that file's imports:

* a module invocation (``python -m pkg.mod``) always works;
* a script invocation (``python path/to/file.py``) works only if the target
  file has no relative imports.

The check is static — it reads the invocation and the target file. It does not
run training, which needs data, an EDA artefact directory and a configured
split.
